## Application Architecture
Jambook is a fullstack site built with:
* React and Redux for frontend 
* Flask Server & Python for the backend 
* PostgreSQL as the database
* Node.js
* AlchemySQL as the ORM that works well with Python on the backend.



## Next Steps and Future Features
This is a basic and clean UI experience for getting authenticated, signing up as a user and start posting and others can log in and reply to a post in a comment. It is all logged and disaplyed by which user and how many days since the post/comment.

In the next sprint:
* Adding a seacrh feature so as a user one can easily at the top of the page type any word/phrase in and have the results displayed and the ability to click it to be taken to that post.
* Adding a "like" feature so as a user one could like a post or a comment that they chose or unlike it.
